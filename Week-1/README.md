# Week 1: C++ Foundations & STL Basics

## 🎯 Goal
Build a strong foundation in C++ and STL so that syntax, memory, and basic data-structure usage do not become a barrier while solving DSA problems.

This week focuses on understanding how C++ works internally, how STL should be used correctly, and how to reason about time and space complexity before coding.

- Binary search helpers
- Iterator-based programming

---

### Day 7: Time & Space Complexity
- Big-O notation
- Space and auxiliary space
- In-place vs extra space algorithms
- STL time complexity
- Performance pitfalls (TLE)

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- Strong understanding of C++ syntax and behavior
- Clear memory model (stack, references, pointers)
- Correct usage of STL containers and algorithms
- Ability to analyze time and space complexity before coding
- Focus on clean, safe, and efficient code

## 🚀 Status
✅ Week-1 completed successfully  
📌 Focused on foundations, STL usage, and analytical thinking  
📌 No heavy problem-solving yet (conceptual mastery first)

## 🔜 Next
Week-2: Arrays  

Focus on array-based problem solving using patterns such as:
- Single-pass scans
- Hashing with arrays
- Subarray thinking
- Prefix sums
- Two pointers

Goal is to build strong problem-solving intuition before moving to advanced data structures.
