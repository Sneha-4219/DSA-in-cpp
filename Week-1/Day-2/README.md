# Week 1 – Day 2: Control Flow & Loops (Thinking Day)

## 🎯 Goal
Develop strong logical thinking using conditional statements and loops so that program flow control becomes natural while solving DSA problems.

---

## 📘 Topics Covered
- Conditional statements (`if`, `if-else`, `else-if`, `switch`)
- Nested conditions
- Looping constructs:
  - `for` loop
  - `while` loop
  - `do-while` loop
- Loop control statements (`break`, `continue`)
- Common loop patterns (counting, accumulator, reverse)
- Manual dry-run and execution flow understanding
