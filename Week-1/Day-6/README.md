# Week 1 – Day 6: STL Stacks, Queues & Algorithms

## 🎯 Goal
Understand and correctly use STL containers and algorithms so that common data-structure logic is not reinvented manually while solving DSA problems.

---

## 📘 Topics Covered
- Stack (LIFO principle)
- Queue (FIFO principle)
- Deque (double-ended queue)
- Priority Queue (heap-based structure)
- STL Algorithms (`sort`, `reverse`, `min_element`, `max_element`, `count`, `find`)
- Binary search helpers (`binary_search`, `lower_bound`, `upper_bound`)
- Iterator ranges (`begin()`, `end()`)
