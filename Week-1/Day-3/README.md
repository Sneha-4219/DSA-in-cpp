# Week 1 – Day 3: Functions & Memory Basics

## 🎯 Goal
Learn how to structure programs using functions and understand the basics of variable scope and memory behavior in C++.

---

## 📘 Topics Covered
- Function declaration, definition, and call
- Return values and `void` functions
- Parameter passing:
  - Pass by value
  - Pass by reference (introduction)
- Variable scope:
  - Local variables
  - Global variables
- Lifetime of variables
- Inline functions (introduction)
- Memory basics:
  - Stack vs Heap (conceptual)

| `functions_basics.cpp` | Function syntax, calls, return types, scope, inline examples |
| `functions_practice.cpp` | Logic-based problems using functions |
| `README.md` | Day-3 learning summary |

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Functions help break programs into reusable and readable blocks
- Pass by value does not modify original variables
- Pass by reference allows direct modification of data
- Local variables are safer than global variables
- Inline functions are useful for small and frequently used logic
- Function calls and local variables are stored on stack memory
