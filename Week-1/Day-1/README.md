# Week 1 – Day 1: C++ Language Basics (Foundation Day)

## 🎯 Goal
Build a strong foundation in C++ so that syntax does not become a barrier while solving DSA problems.

---

## 📘 Topics Covered
- Program structure in C++
- Input and Output (`cin`, `cout`)
- Data types (`int`, `long long`, `double`, `char`, `bool`)
- Type modifiers (`signed`, `unsigned`)
- Constants (`const`, `#define`)
- Operators (arithmetic, relational, logical, assignment)
- Type casting
- Overflow and precision behavior
