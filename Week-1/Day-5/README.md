# Week 1 – Day 5: STL Containers (Core Day)

## 🎯 Goal
Develop the ability to think in STL containers instead of raw loops, so that data handling and logic become cleaner, faster, and interview-ready.

---

## 📘 Topics Covered
- STL overview (containers, algorithms, iterators – conceptual)
- `vector` (dynamic arrays)
  - Size vs capacity
  - `push_back`, `pop_back`
  - Access methods (`[]`, `at()`)
- `pair`
  - Basic pairs
  - Nested pairs
  - Vector of pairs
- `map` and `unordered_map`
  - Key–value storage
  - Ordered vs unordered maps
  - Frequency counting pattern
- `set` and `unordered_set`
  - Unique element storage
  - Ordered vs unordered sets
  - Lookup and duplicate detection
- Range-based `for` loops
- Use of `const auto&` for safe and efficient traversal

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Why `vector` is the default container in C++
- Difference between size and capacity in vectors
- How pairs group related data cleanly
- How `map` / `unordered_map` simplify frequency-based problems
- Why `unordered_map` and `unordered_set` are usually preferred for speed
- How `set` guarantees uniqueness and sorted order
- How range-based loops improve readability and safety
