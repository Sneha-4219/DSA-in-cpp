# Week 2 – Day 1: Array Basics & Simple Scan

## 🎯 Goal
Build a strong foundation in arrays so that traversal and basic array logic become automatic while solving DSA problems.

---

## 📘 Topics Covered
- What is an array in memory
- 0-based indexing
- Array traversal using loops
- Tracking values during traversal
- Single-pass scan logic
- Common beginner array pitfalls (off-by-one errors)

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Arrays are stored in contiguous memory
- Direct index access is O(1)
- Most array problems rely on single-pass traversal
- Tracking variables (min, max, count) is a core pattern
- Optimized solutions often come from comparing current values with past data
