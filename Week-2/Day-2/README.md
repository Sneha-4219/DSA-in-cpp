# Week 2 – Day 2: Two Sum & Hashing Introduction

## 🎯 Goal
Understand how hashing optimizes array problems and learn the classic **Two Sum** pattern commonly asked in interviews.

---

## 📘 Topics Covered
- Brute force vs optimized approach
- Introduction to hashing
- Using `unordered_map` and `unordered_set`
- “Seen before?” logic
- Time complexity improvement from O(n²) to O(n)

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Nested loops often indicate a brute force solution
- Hashing allows constant-time lookup
- Store previously seen elements while scanning
- Many optimizations follow the “have I seen this before?” pattern
- Hash maps and sets are essential interview tools
