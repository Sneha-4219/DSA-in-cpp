# Week 2: Arrays & Core Problem-Solving Patterns

## 🎯 Goal
Build strong **array problem-solving intuition** so that common patterns like scanning, hashing, prefix sums, and two pointers become natural tools rather than tricks.

This week focuses on **thinking in patterns**, understanding *why* optimizations work, and developing the habit of solving problems efficiently and confidently.
