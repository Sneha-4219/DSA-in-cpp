# Week 2 – Day 7: Revision, Consolidation & Confidence Check

## 🎯 Goal
Strengthen confidence by revising key array problems and reinforcing core patterns learned throughout Week-2.

The goal of this day is **clarity and recall**, not solving new problems.

---

## 📘 Topics Covered
- Revisiting previously solved problems
- Pattern recognition across different questions
- Explaining solutions without looking at code
- Writing clean and confident solutions
- Connecting problems to underlying ideas

---

## 🧠 Why Revision Matters

Solving a problem once is not mastery.  
Mastery comes when you can:
- Explain the solution clearly
- Recognize the pattern instantly
- Write the code without hesitation

Day-7 exists to convert **practice into confidence**.

## 🔁 Problems Revisited

### 1️⃣ LeetCode 1 – Two Sum
**Pattern:** Hashing + “seen before” logic

What to recall:
- Why brute force is O(n²)
- Why hashing reduces it to O(n)
- Why we store elements *after* checking

---

### 2️⃣ LeetCode 53 – Maximum Subarray
**Pattern:** Local vs global best (Kadane’s Algorithm)

What to recall:
- Why we reset the running sum
- Difference between current sum and maximum sum
- Why this works even with negative numbers

---

### 3️⃣ LeetCode 121 – Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
**Pattern:** Tracking minimum so far

What to recall:
- Why nested loops are unnecessary
- How tracking past information optimizes the solution
- How this problem relates to Kadane’s logic

## 📂 Files in This Folder

| File Name | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `lc_1_two_sum.cpp` | Revisited for hashing pattern confidence |
| `lc_53_maximum_subarray.cpp` | Rewritten to reinforce Kadane’s intuition |
| `lc_121_best_time_to_buy_and_sell_stock.cpp` | Re-solved to strengthen scan + tracking logic |

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Patterns repeat more than problems
- One-pass scanning solves many “hard” questions
- Hashing is about remembering, not searching
- Confidence comes from explanation, not speed
- Clean thinking leads to clean code
